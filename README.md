# Sort Simulation
Java-based program that sorts variously-sized rings using selection, bubble, and insertion sort, demonstrated with Java graphics.

## Functionality and Graphics
The program begins by prompting for the number of rings (recommended less than 15, anything over becomes buggy)
and then asks if the user would like them randomly assorted or sorted in reverse.

The rings are generated, each with a random color, and an arrow points to the rings making the current swap.
When each stack is sorted, the number of swaps will be printed at the bottom of the page, allowing the user to compare
which sorting algorithm is more efficient based on operations performed.
